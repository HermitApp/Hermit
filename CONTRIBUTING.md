Contributing to Hermit
======================

Contributing to Hermit is fairly simple. Just follow the basic git flow. Create
your own branch, commit the changes and submit a pull request.

At the moment I am not too particular about what else gets committed or what the
expectations are, until I find a process and stick to it myself. Below is a list
of criteria i am looking consider.

- Fully documented code, with XML tags
- Passing build
- Updated wiki if necessary
